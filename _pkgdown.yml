     Our `dataset` R package aims to help the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability,
         and Reuse of digital assets, particularly datacubes and datasets used in statistics and data
         analysis.

     This package is in an early development phase. The current dataset S3 class is inherited
         from the base R data.frame. Later versions may change to the modern
         [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), which carries a larger dependency footprint
         but easier to work with. Easy interoperability with the
         [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html) package remains a top development priority.
