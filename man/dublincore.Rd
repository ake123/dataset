dublincore(df)

dublincore_add(
  df,
  title,
  creator,
  publisher,

  date = NULL,
  source = NULL,
  language = NULL,
  format = NULL,
  rights = NULL,
  description = NULL,
  type = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{An R object of type data.frame, or inherited data.table, tibble; alternatively a well
structured R list.}

\item{title}{\href{http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title}{dct:title}, a name given to the resource.
\code{\link{datacite}} allows the use of alternate titles, too.}

\item{creator}{An entity primarily responsible for making the resource. \href{http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator}{dct:creator}
Corresponds to \code{Creator} in \code{\link{datacite}}.}

\item{subject}{In \href{http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/subject}{dct:subject}. In
\code{\link{datacite}} it is a recommended property for discovery.}

\item{date}{Corresponds to a point or period of time associated with an event in the
lifecycle of the resource. \href{http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date}{dct:date}.
\code{Date} is also recommended for
discovery in \code{\link{datacite}}.}

\item{source}{A related resource from which the described resource is derived. See \href{http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/source}{dct:source}.}

\item{language}{The primary language of the resource. Allowed values are taken from
IETF BCP 47, ISO 639-1 language code. See \code{\link{add_language}}. Corresponds to Language in Datacite.}

\item{format}{The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource.
\href{    http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/format}{dct:format}
Examples of dimensions include size and duration. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled
vocabulary such as the list of Internet Media Types \link{MIME}. It is simlar to \code{Format} in
\code{\link{datacite}}.}

\item{rights}{Corresponds to \href{http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/rights}{dct:rights} and
\code{\link{datacite}} Rights. Information about rights held in and over the resource.
Typically, rights information includes a statement about various property rights associated with the resource, including intellectual property rights.}

\item{description}{An account of the resource. It may include but is not limited to:
an abstract, a table of contents, a graphical representation, or a free-text account of the resource.
\href{http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description}{dct:description}. In
\code{\link{datacite}} it is recommended for discovery.}

\item{type}{The nature or genre of the resource. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the DCMI Type Vocabulary
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-type-vocabulary/}{\link{DCMITYPE}}.
For a dataset, the correct term is \code{Dataset}.
To describe the file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource, use the
Format element.}

\item{pulisher}{Corresponds to dct:publisher and Publisher in DataCite.
The name of the entity that holds, archives, publishes prints, distributes, releases,
issues, or produces the resource. This property will be used to formulate the citation,
so consider the prominence of the role. For software, use Publisher for the
code repository. If there is an entity other than a code repository, that
"holds, archives, publishes, prints, distributes, releases, issues, or produces" the
code, use the property Contributor/contributorType/ hostingInstitution for the code
repository.}

\item{relation}{A related resource. Recommended best practice is to identify the related
resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system. See: \href{http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/relation}{dct:relation}.
Similar to \code{RelatedItem} in \code{\link{datacite}}, which is recommended for discovery.}
}
\description{
Add metadata conforming the \href{https://schema.datacite.org/}{DataCite Metadata Schema}
to datasets, i.e. structured R data.frame or list objects, for an accurate and consistent identification
of a resource for citation and retrieval purposes.
}
\details{
DataCite is a leading global non-profit organisation that provides persistent identifiers
(DOIs) for research data and other research outputs. Organizations within the research
community join DataCite as members to be able to assign DOIs to all their research
outputs. This way, their outputs become discoverable and associated metadata is made
available to the community.
DataCite then develops additional services to improve the DOI management experience,
making it easier for our members to connect and share their DOIs with the broader
research ecosystem and to assess the use of their DOIs within that ecosystem.
DataCite is an active participant in the research community and promotes data sharing
and citation through community-building efforts and outreach activities.

The \code{ResourceType} property will be by definition "Dataset".
The \code{Size} attribute (e.g. bytes, pages, inches, etc.) will automatically added to the dataset.
