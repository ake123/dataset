Our datasets are defined in a way that their dimensions can be easily and unambigously reduced to triples for RDF applications; they can be easily serialized to, or synchronized with semantic web applications with the [rdflib](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdflib/vignettes/rdf_intro.html) package^[Carl Boettiger: [A tidyverse loverâ€™s intro to RDF](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdflib/vignettes/rdf_intro.html)].
