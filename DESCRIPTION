Description: Create well-referenced, well-described, interoperable datasets in R ready for 
    publication and use on the (semantic) web. A subjective interpretation of the 
    \href{https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/}{W3C DataSet} recommendation and the datacube 
    model, which is also used in the global Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange standards, 
    the application of the connected \href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/}{Dublin Core} 
    and \href{https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-44}{DataCite} standards 
    preferred by European open science repositories to improve the findability, accessibility,
    interoperability and reusability of the datasets.
